### Sylvie Bartusek - portfolio website 

Here is the latest HTML and CSS code I wrote for my personal website, which features different creative projects I've explored as well as tech projects I have worked on. 

The website can be found here: [sylviebartusek.com](https://sylviebartusek.github.io/website/index.html)

FEATURES TO ADD FOR BETTER USER EXPERIENCE:
- Clicking an image allows for a user to enter full screen on that image.
- Embedded videos from vimeo and youtube respond dynamically to the window size. Currently, they remain pretty small, which is especially not ideal when the window is larger.
